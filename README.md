# DiscordRoles

This is a simple discord bot to create a message where users can self-assign roles. Many bots can already do this, but have limitaions as to how many roles they can do without paying. 

You must complete the config.json as described in the sample, and the CSV file for the roles as well. The CSV takes two values. The first value is the name of the role in the server, the second value is the name you want displayed on the button. Yes, it's that simple. 

If you have any feature requests feel free to make a PR.
